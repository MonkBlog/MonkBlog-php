A blogging engine built on Laravel 5.1.

## Homestead local dev instructions

If you prefer to use Homestead over Docker, you can find [instructions on the Laravel website](http://laravel.com/docs/5.1/homestead).

## Docker local dev instructions

If you don't yet have Docker installed, install it [according to the Docker website](https://www.docker.com).

After you have Docker installed, this command will get you started:

    docker-compose up

### Dependency installation and configuration

Next, you'll need to run these commands, in order:

```
cp .env.example .env
composer install
npm install (or, better yet, yarn)
bower install
gulp
docker exec monkblogphp_app_1 php artisan key:generate
docker exec monkblogphp_app_1 php artisan migrate
docker exec monkblogphp_app_1 php artisan db:seed
```

### Adding your first admin user

Add an admin user by using the following console command:

```
php artisan user:generate
```

If you want to run it through a Docker container, do it like this:

```
docker exec -it monkblogphp_app_1 php artisan user:generate
```

## Admin Interface

Access the admin interface via `/admin` on your site.
