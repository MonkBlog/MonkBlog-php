A blogging engine built on Laravel. It's specifically built for my personal blog, http://benovermyer.com, though with a bit of tweaking on the visual side can be used for any blog site.

The intent is to have a full blog engine by the end of Q1 2015. Details on this plan are available at the [afore-mentioned blog](http://benovermyer.com).
